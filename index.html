        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Data Science student at UC San Diego with 2+ years of experience
          blending business development, marketing analytics, and community
          engagement with data-driven insights. Currently, I work as a Marketing
          Communications Specialist at UC San Diego IT Services and as a
          Community Specialist at Tech Voice Indonesia, where I help grow and
          engage a community of 1,600+ members.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion lies at the intersection of data, strategy, and
          storytelling. Whether I'm developing communication strategies,
          conducting market research, or building community programs, I leverage
          analytical thinking and creative problem-solving to drive meaningful
          impact. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my
          technical and business knowledge.
